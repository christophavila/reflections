Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A: It is useful to get a backup of you work in the cloud and also to make public what is ready to be published.

 Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	A: I would push commits to public repositories manually and commits to private repositories automatically (if possible)

 Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 	A: Fork:  Duplicate repository inside GitHub.
 	   Clones: Dupliate repository inside your laptop or from Github to your laptop
       Branches: stream of commits.
